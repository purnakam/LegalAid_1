                        <p> <a>Section 227</a>
                            <br> Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to
                            state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any
                            statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not
                            believe to be true, is said to give false evidence.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is
                            made verbally or otherwise.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within
                            the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by
                            stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he
                            knows a thing which he does not know.
                            <br>Illustrations.
                            <br>(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees,
                            falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B’s claim. A has given false
                            evidence.
                            <br>(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain
                            signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the handwriting of
                            Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence.
                            <br>(c) A, knowing the general character of Z’s handwriting, states that he believes a
                            certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A’s
                            statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the
                            signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.
                            <br>(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at
                            a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives
                            false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.
                            <br>(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or
                            translation of a statement or document which he is bound by oath to interpret or translate
                            truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or
                            translation. A has given false evidence.</p>

                        statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person who in such proceeding is to
                        form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point
                        material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”.

                        <br>(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be
                        found in that box, and that this circumstance may cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has
                        fabricated false evidence.
                        <br>(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative
                        evidence in a Court. A has fabricated false evidence.
                        <br>(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes
                        a letter in imitation of Z’s handwriting, purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in
                        such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the officers of
                        the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence.</p>

                            <br> (1) Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial
                            proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a
                            judicial proceeding, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term
                            which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to ten
                            thousand rupees.
                            <br>(2) Whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any case other than
                            that referred to in sub-section (1), shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
                            for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine which may
                            extend to five thousand rupees.
                            <br>Explanation 1.—A trial before a Court-martial is a judicial proceeding.
                            <br>Explanation 2.—An investigation directed by law preliminary to a proceeding before
                            a Court, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place
                            before a Court.

                            ought to be committed for trial, makes on oath a statement which he knows to be false. As
                            this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence.
                            <br>Explanation 3.—An investigation directed by a Court according to law, and

                            <br>(a) if the offence is punishable with death, be punished with imprisonment of
                            either description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable
                            to fine;
                            <br>(b) if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment

                            <br>Explanation.––“Offence” in this section includes any act committed at any place
                            out of India, which, if committed in India, would be punishable under any of the following
                            sections, namely 103, 105, 307, sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 309, sub-sections (2),
                            (3), (4) and (5) of section 310, 311, 312, clauses (f) and (g) of section 326, sub-sections (4),
                            (6), (7) and (8) of section 331, clauses (a) and (b) of section 332 and every such act shall,
                            for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be punishable as if the accused person had
                            been guilty of it in India.
                            <br>Exception.—This section shall not extend to any case in which the harbour or
                            concealment is by the spouse of the offender.

                            <br>A, knowing that B has committed dacoity, knowingly conceals B in order to screen
                            him from legal punishment. Here, as B is liable to imprisonment for life, A is liable to
                            imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding three years, and is also liable
                            to fine.</p>
