                            Sovereign Power, and intended to be used as equivalent to, or as a substitute for

                            <br>(2) “coin” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in section 2 of the

                            stamp of a different denomination;
                            <br>(4) a person commits the offence of counterfeiting coin who intending to practise
                            deception, or knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised, causes a
                            genuine coin to appear like a different coin; and
                            <br>(5) the offence of “counterfeiting coin” includes diminishing the weight or
                            alteration of the composition, or alteration of the appearance of the coin.</p>
